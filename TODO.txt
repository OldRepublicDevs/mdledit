TO DO:
 - Add more stuff to editordlg (texture names, controller data, for example) OR maybe not

 - NWMax scripts: see if it's possible to import channels 2,3,4 and export channels 3,4.
 - Fix events (either here or in NWmax, check with ndix UR)

 - make saber import

 - viewer for Walkmesh (somewhat done)
 - interpret WOK (mostly done)
 - AABB tree creator


 Binary diff shortcomings:
 1. I cannot accurately reproduce the correct radius and average values. For now, I will settle with the largest radius and the mean average of all points.
 2. unknown padding mismatches
 4. precision issues, probably cannot avoid this
 5. inverted counter - I can create the correct values, but I cannot figure out how to count them


What does MDLedit change after importing and compiling the model? What needs to be redone, recalculated?
1. Texture names
2. Tangent space vectors
3. MDX bitmap and sizes
4. trimesh flags (maybe I should leave these to the ascii?), otherwise there's a lot of flags that should be made editable

It seems parts 4 - 6 need to be rerun

NOT changing:
1. any coordinates. If I am, it is strictly on top of the compiled data, not affecting any calculations.
