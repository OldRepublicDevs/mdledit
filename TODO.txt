 1. viewer for Walkmesh (somewhat done)
 2. interpret WOK (mostly done)
 3. AABB tree creator


 Binary diff shortcomings:
 1. I cannot accurately reproduce the correct radius and average values. For now, I will settle with the largest radius and the mean average of all points.
 2. unknown padding mismatches
 3. unknown controller int16 mismatches
 4. precision issues, probably cannot avoid this
 5. inverted counter - I can create the correct values, but I cannot figure out how to count them



 Supernode sequence.
 1. If there is no supermodel, supernode# is the same as node#.
 else:
    2. For every matching node name, copy the supernode#.
    3. For every node that does not match, continue the numbering from the largest supernode#.
