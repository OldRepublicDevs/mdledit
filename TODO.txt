TO DO:
 - Make import for bezier keys
 - Make new duplicate node numbering
 - Add more stuff to editordlg (texture names, controller data, for example)
 - Create model-wide texture name replacer
 - NWMax scripts: see if it's possible to import channels 2,3,4 and export channels 3,4.
 - Calculate the radius from the average
 - make saber import
 - test bezier keys
 - viewer for Walkmesh (somewhat done)
 - interpret WOK (mostly done)
 - AABB tree creator


 Binary diff shortcomings:
 1. I cannot accurately reproduce the correct radius and average values. For now, I will settle with the largest radius and the mean average of all points.
 2. unknown padding mismatches
 3. unknown controller int16 mismatches
 4. precision issues, probably cannot avoid this
 5. inverted counter - I can create the correct values, but I cannot figure out how to count them
