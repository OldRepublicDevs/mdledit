 1. viewer for Walkmesh (somewhat done)
 2. interpret WOK (mostly done)
 3. ascii importer (mostly done)
 4. after import, calculate adjacent faces, face normals, vertex normals (mostly done)

 For today:
 1. add bitangent and tanget calculations for VerticesEqual
 2. Make debug show if constraint is 0.0 for a failed normal calculation

 Binary diff shortcomings:
 1. I cannot accurately reproduce the correct radius and average values. For now, I will settle with the largest radius and the mean average of all points.
 2. unknown padding mismatches
 3. unknown controller int16 mismatches
 4. precision issues, probably cannot avoid this
 5. inverted counter - I can create the correct values, but I cannot figure out how to count them

 Calculations:
 1. face adjacencies -DONE
 2. face normals -DONE
 3. vertex normals -DONE (but they now depend on smoothing groups, which I cannot convert from the model - working on that)
 4. AABB tree creator


 Smoothing group calculation:
 1. determine linked faces for every vertex
 2. go through all vertices and for each
    2a. Take all welded face normals into account
    2b. Calculate a vertex normal for every combination of unwelded faces + all welded faces
    2c. Check if we have the right outcome, if so, save a boolean into LinkedFace whether a face smooths over this vert or not


    1. check if all the nodes that have index i, also have some index j. If they do, delete all i.
    ie: for the first node, save index i and the binary int of the indexes, then
        every time i is present, remove all indexes from the binary int that are not present in this node
        repeat until the binary int is 0, at which point we may stop. If we get to the end, that means that
        the binary int is > 0, so we may now delete all i.
